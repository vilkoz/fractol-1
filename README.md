## Fractol

**Objective** of this project is to create fractal exploration program. 

Project coded on **C**, calculated with **OpenCL**, rendered with **X11**(minilibx).

Fractal ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal)) is a curve or geometrical figure, each part of which has the same statistical character as the whole. They are useful in modelling structures (such as snowflakes) in which similar patterns recur at progressively smaller scales, and in describing partly random or chaotic phenomena such as crystal growth and galaxy formation.

Which refer to ![eqn1](http://warp.povusers.org/Mandelbrot/eqn1.png) where ![eqn2](http://warp.povusers.org/Mandelbrot/eqn2.png)

**Howto**

Build binary named **fractol**
		
   	$> make all

Erase binary
		
   	$> make fclean
